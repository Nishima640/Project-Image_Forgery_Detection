Image forgery detection is a crucial area of research aimed at identifying and authenticating digital images that have been tampered with or manipulated. With the widespread availability of powerful image editing tools, it has become easier to create forged images, leading to the need for robust forgery detection techniques. There are various techniques of image forgery but we model Copy-Move forgery which is one of the serious threats in this field. Copying and pasting an image or part of the image in the same image is called Copy-Move forgery. Hence there arises the need for an improved algorithm for diagnosing similar duplicated regions in an efficient manner. In this project, we propose frequency-based approaches using a Dyadic Wavelet Transform (DyWT) combined with Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) based algorithm to detect copy-move forgery. These algorithms are used to detect the forgery separately and hence compare the results using performance measures such as precision, recall, and accuracy. We found that the accuracy, precision and recall was much better when we used DyWT than DCT.
